This is a **C program** for a simple Railway Reservation System. It's a command-line tool that helps you manage and book train tickets. The program is designed for two types of users: **Administrators** and **Regular Users**.

## How It Works

The program stores all its data in **binary files** within a main folder called `RRS`. This way, all your user accounts, train details, and booking history are saved even after you close the program.

The main menu will ask for a username and password. The system will then show you the options you can use based on whether you're an admin or a regular user.

## Getting Started

1.  **Compile the code**: Use a C compiler (like GCC) to build the program.
2.  **Run the program**: The program will create the necessary folders and files to store data when you run it for the first time.
3.  **Log in**: Use your credentials to log in and start using the system.
