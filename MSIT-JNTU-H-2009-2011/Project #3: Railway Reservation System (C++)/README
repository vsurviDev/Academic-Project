### **Railway Reservation System** ðŸš‚

This project is a console-based **Railway Reservation System** developed in C++. It simulates the core functionalities of a real-world railway booking system, allowing for both **administrator and user logins**. The application manages train details, user information, and ticket bookings using file I/O for persistent data storage.

### **Features**

#### **Administrator Panel**
The administrator can manage the system's core data, including:
* **User Management:** Add new users and display a list of all registered users.
* **Train Management:** Add new trains and display a complete list of all train details.
* **Schedule Management:** View the trip schedule for all trains.

#### **User Panel**
Registered users have access to various search and booking functionalities:
* **Search Trains:** Find trains based on various criteria, including source, destination, date, and time duration.
* **Show Availability:** Check berth availability for each class on a specific train.
* **Book Tickets:** Reserve and book tickets for a desired trip.

### **Technical Details**

* **Language:** C++
* **Data Management:** The system uses **binary file I/O** for efficient data storage and retrieval, simulating a simple database.
* **Concepts:**
    * **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files to maintain data persistence.
    * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The code likely uses classes (`userDetails`, `trainDetails`, `trainTrip`) to encapsulate data and behavior.
    * **Data Structures:** Utilizes a `list` to manage and iterate through train and user data.
    * **User Interface:** A menu-driven console interface for a clean user experience.

### **How to Run**

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).
3.  Run the executable. The program will create the necessary data directories and files on the first run.
4.  Log in as an administrator to add initial data or as a user to start booking.
